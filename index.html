    <p>When Pamela Drayton arrived home from her new job in 1982, she immediately had to undress. She wouldn’t let her clothes touch her bed. She hit the shower. </p>
    <p>She had just finished her first day as a corrections officer at Rikers Island. </p>
    <p>“What it looked like, what it smelled like, what it tasted like – it was something I couldn’t imagine,” Drayton said.</p>
    <p>More recently, as the mother of a former inmate, Drayton knows that the conditions haven’t changed. </p>
    <p>But in August of 2018, Mayor Bill De Blasio unveiled plans to reduce Rikers Island’s population to 5,000 people and replace the nearly 90-year-old jail with four facilities throughout the city. The goal includes integrating the new jails with
      their surrounding communities. This is in part a move to reduce mass incarceration – an issue that skyrocketed in the 1970s and is only now slowly on a decline.</p>
    <p>Drayton understands first-hand what the change could mean for both inmates and jail employees. </p>

    <p>“It eases the frustration and anger the officers would go through,” Drayton said about what a shorter commute to the jail from their homes and courts they need to take inmates to. Less stress on the employees could
      mean better treatment of the inmates. </p>
    <p>Today, more than 2 million people in the United States are behind bars, but the country’s pattern of mass incarceration didn’t always exist. The prison system saw a major shift in policy in the 1970s. </p>
    <p>Political rhetoric pushed a “war on drugs” and “tough on crime” agenda that led to more punitive policies, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. And it disproportionately hit communities of color. Over the years, most of the growth
      in
      jail population was found at the state level. In 2015, around 50,983 people were in prison in New York State.</p>

    <p>While incarceration rates have a decline in New York since 1999 as public opinion changed, political rhetoric shifted and crime rates dropped, attention needs to stay trained on the issue as a whole for progress to continue, said Bryan
      Furst,
      the George A. Katz Fellow at the Brennan Center’s Justice Program, whether it’s the public’s tax dollars that pay to run large prisons or otherwise. </p>
    <p>It’s promising to see candidates, including many in the Democratic primary for president, focusing on mass incarceration, he said.</p>
    <p>“The scope of the problem today is so large that nobody’s untouched by it,” said Bryan Furst, the George A. Katz Fellow at the Brennan Center’s Justice Program, whether it’s the public’s tax dollars that pay to run large prisons or
      otherwise.</p>
    <p>Mass incarceration hits close to home for those with loved ones in prison. </p>
    <p>“They don’t belong to themselves. They don’t belong to their families.”</p>
